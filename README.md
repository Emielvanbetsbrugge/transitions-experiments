# Smooth scrolling experiment

I had some time on my hands to experiment with the Smooth Scrolling from Baptiste Briel [Smooth Scrolling](https://github.com/baptistebriel/smooth-scrolling)

With these experiments I mainly focus on understanding what they have build and how to use it. But also how it works. Found it really interesting performance wise. Was now a short experimenting with this, but hope to get further into this. Like the natural parallax this creates.
